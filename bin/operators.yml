commands:
  compress: uncompress
  base64: base64 -d
  cat: cat
  dd status=none: dd status=none if=/tmp/%{file}

# Unfortunately, some commands add newlines to the output (e.g. base64),
# whereas others do not (e.g. compress), so we need to chop it off as required.
nl_adders:
  - base64
  - base64 -d
  - cat # ??? to check ???
